# AI Buddy User Guide

## Installation and first launch

Download the macOS or Windows installer from the product download page. AI Buddy includes Electron, Node, and its pinned DSH dependencies, so normal users do not need to install Node.js or pnpm separately.

On first launch, the application prepares the default profile and starts the official DSH Web surface locally. Closing the window normally hides it; use **Quit** from the tray when you want to stop the application and Host process.

## Profiles

A profile is a composition of DSH bundles, dependencies, and patches. The tray **Profile** menu lists existing profiles and the lazy `desktop` and `web` defaults.

Selecting a profile performs an orderly restart. The new profile becomes the last-known-good choice only after the Host, window, and browser client all start successfully; a failed startup returns to the previous working choice. Official profiles normally use the same DSH home, so sessions, settings, and storage do not need to be migrated. A custom configuration (patch) can deliberately redirect a persistence root, in which case that profile's configuration wins.

Switching profiles does not silently copy plugins from the old profile into the new one. Use an explicit profile in the terminal when preparing another profile, or use the default commands after switching.

## Compatibility and advanced modes

- **Compatibility mode** uses the upstream Web client and the selected profile's own layout/sidebar/conversation composition. It is the closest presentation to ordinary Harness.
- **Advanced mode** keeps the same upstream Web carrier while adding Desktop-owned framing, layout, Mica/vibrancy, and native drag regions. It is intended for a fuller desktop presentation.

Changing mode restarts the application; it does not hot-swap root slots or native materials in a live renderer. Linux provides compatibility mode only.

## Local Web port

Desktop lets the operating system choose a random local Web port by default (`dsh-desktop.port: 0`), which avoids collisions with other services. Browser `localStorage` is isolated by origin, so UI plugins that store settings there need a fixed port to read the same settings after Desktop restarts:

```yaml
dsh-desktop:
  port: 43189
```

The port must be an integer from `0` through `65535`. Changing it performs an orderly restart, and the service remains bound only to `127.0.0.1`. If another program already uses a fixed port, Desktop cannot start; release that port or change the setting back to `0` or another available port.

## Internal Market

New sessions default to the upstream **Code** (PTC) preset: standard file, terminal, search, skill, plan, subagent, and Ralph tools, plus TypeScript Code Mode presentation. You can switch back to `standard` in settings. Windows still hides the incompatible `minimal` preset.

**Settings → Internal Market** is the desktop-owned left-nav settings section. It does not occupy the official Plugins tab strip. Inner pages are **Featured**, **Workbench**, and **MCP**. Official **Plugins** still has Plugin configuration, Plugin list, and **Plugin market**.

**Settings → Internal Market → Featured** lists curated recommendations such as `dsh-better-sidebar` and `dsh-context`, plus a starting office-IM pair: official DingTalk Stream (`dsh-dingtalk-channel`) and the official WeCom AI Bot (`dsh-wecom`). These are curated recommendations, not an exclusive store or allowlist, and they do not install at launch. **One-click install** verifies packages through Plugin market and writes the current profile; after a restart they load on the next startup. You can also install one plugin at a time. Feishu, aggregators, and other community channels still install from **Plugin market** or `dsh plugin add`. Narrow screens can later add the community plugin `dsh-web-mobile`; it is not the default workbench path. Catalog listing is not a security review. The plugin market does not preselect a source; one-click install selects DSH 1024Store first. Restart AI Buddy after installing or enabling plugins. Put credentials in the plugin config or the local credential store; do not commit secrets.

**Settings → Internal Market → Workbench** keeps local models, data home, and remote access. It is no longer the recommended-plugin catalog.

External MCP servers use the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`. Add stdio or HTTP servers under **Settings → Internal Market → MCP**. AI Buddy does not ship tokens or default child processes. Saving also requires a restart.

`Mod+K` opens the desktop Command Palette for new sessions, session search, and workspace starts. It does not replace the official conversation surface. Local models, Data home, and Remote access switch inside **Workbench** instead of each taking a Plugins tab. **Local models** probes loopback Ollama / LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible runtimes. It may start a supported runtime that is not running, will not take over a service that is already listening, and does not ship tokens. **Data home** previews and merges another DSH home; nothing migrates silently, and conflicting files are preserved. **Remote access** stays off by default: it syncs sessions, files, and a host shell instead of encoding the Electron window. DSH remains on `127.0.0.1`. The validated private entrance may be a Tailscale Serve HTTPS hostname; the trust fence is reachability, not authentication.

## Plugin management

Plugins are extensions that add capabilities to DSH, such as models, tools, interfaces, and workflows. AI Buddy uses the same plugin system as official Harness, so official plugins install and work directly; multiple plugins follow the same conventions and can be installed and used together.

For everyday installs, start with the built-in [plugin marketplace](../dsh-community-market/README.md): open the **Plugin market** tab under **Settings > Plugins**, or use the sidebar launcher. The market can browse catalog sources, preview plugins, and perform Host-managed install, uninstall, or enable/disable for npm packages that pass its checks. Listing only means a catalog returned metadata; it is not a security review. Installed plugins run as local code with the user's privileges.

The official CLI remains available. Ordinary DSH plugins use the upstream CLI semantics:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop add <plugin>
dsh plugin --profile desktop remove <plugin>
dsh plugin --profile desktop update
```

In the terminal opened from the AI Buddy tray, bare `dsh` and plugin commands without `--profile` default to the active profile:

```sh
dsh plugin add <plugin>
dsh plugin remove <plugin>
dsh plugin update
```

An explicit `--profile <name>` always wins. Restart AI Buddy after plugin changes so the new bundle enters the Loader composition.

## Opening the terminal

Choose **Open AI Buddy Terminal** from the tray. macOS opens Terminal; Windows prefers Windows Terminal and falls back to PowerShell or Command Prompt when it is unavailable.

The welcome text shows the application version, active profile, profile directory, and DSH home. Desktop creates private `dsh`, `pnpm`, and `node` shims in its user-data directory and prepends that directory only for the new terminal process. It does not modify the system PATH or the user's shell files.

## Updates

Packaged macOS and Windows applications check `https://www.dshdesktop.cn/api/desktop/version` in the background. Startup is not blocked; network errors, non-200 responses, invalid versions, and a server version that is not newer remain silent in the background.

**Check for Updates…** in the tray is a manual check. It shows a result even when the installed version is current, and reports a retry message when the check fails. Only a server version strictly newer than the local version produces a download confirmation. Cancelling never requests the counted download endpoint.

After confirmation, the app first opens the native **Save Update Installer** dialog, defaulting to the Downloads directory. You can choose another directory and filename; cancelling the dialog does not start a download. After the destination is confirmed, the app requests the fixed platform download URL and remembers the installer location. macOS opens the DMG for the user to replace the application in Applications; Windows prepares the NSIS installer and then asks whether to quit and start installation. After the upgrade completes and the app starts again, it asks whether to delete the installer to free disk space or keep it. Download or installer failures do not damage the current version, and the tray operation can be retried.

## Troubleshooting

- **The application reaches the tray**: right-click the tray icon and choose **Export Diagnostics…**. After the privacy confirmation, Desktop creates a `diagnostics-*.zip` archive and reveals it in the file manager.
- **The application crashes repeatedly before the tray appears**: run the installed executable directly with the recovery option. The default Windows installation command is below; replace the path if you selected another installation directory.

  ```powershell
  & "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\AI Buddy\AI Buddy.exe" --export-diagnostics
  ```

  If the npm desktop launcher is installed, `dsh-desktop --export-diagnostics` provides the same archive. This command does not start Host, profiles, plugins, or a window. It prints the absolute diagnostics ZIP path when complete.
- **Diagnostic archive contents**: recent application logs, local Crashpad `.dmp` files, the active-run marker, and `system-info.txt`. System information records Desktop, Electron, Node, platform, and architecture versions. Recognized credentials are masked in logs, but local paths, workspace IDs, session IDs, and crash-time memory fragments may remain. Review the archive before public upload and send sensitive dumps only through a trusted channel.
- **The window disappeared**: check the system tray; closing the window is not quitting.
- **A plugin is missing**: confirm the command or marketplace action targeted the intended profile and restart the application. Recommended Internal Market community plugins also need a restart before they enter the Loader composition.
- **The plugin marketplace will not open**: confirm you are in the AI Buddy desktop composition. The market lives under **Settings > Plugins**; the sidebar button opens the same surface.
- **MCP tools do not appear**: confirm the server is enabled, the command or URL is reachable, and you restarted after saving. AI Buddy does not preinstall GitHub or any other token-bearing server.
- **Local models do not appear**: confirm Ollama or LM Studio is listening on `127.0.0.1`, then scan and apply them under **Settings → Internal Market → Workbench → Local models**. AI Buddy does not ship API keys.
- **Remote access does not open**: enable it, set the Tailscale Serve hostname, and restart. DSH still binds `127.0.0.1` only; do not enable Funnel or rebind to `0.0.0.0`.
- **A terminal command is missing**: open a fresh Desktop terminal from the tray; Desktop does not modify the global PATH.
- **No update notification appeared**: background failures are silent; use the manual tray check to see the result.

The lower-level lifecycle, packaging, and platform limits belong to the developer documentation; see the [documentation index](README.md).
